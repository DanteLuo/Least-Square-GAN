# LeastSquare GAN Implementation

This is a implementation of [least square GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04076.pdf).

And the test has been done on the MNIST dataset and the images will be stored locally.

This is a nicer API which you can adjust your hidden layer params and 
structures easily and very handy to use for your project.
